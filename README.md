**A Structural Grammar Decipherment of the Indus Script**

This repository is a companion page for the published whitepaper that introduces HDT — a rule-based, linguistically agnostic framework that structurally decodes over 300 Indus inscriptions using formal grammar rules. 

Rather than guessing the language behind the Indus script, HDT focuses on **how** the symbols are arranged — uncovering syntax, symbol roles, and grammar-like structure.
